      <title>Panhandle Lake Camp</title>
      <description>We stayed here night #2. It's not far from our first night, but allowed us time to explore the Whittier Ridge trail and swim in the lake.</description>

      <title>Obscurity Lake</title>
      <description>My favorite part of the trail was in this area. Great views and the sound of coyotes off in the distance.</description>

      <title>Bear Camp</title>
      <description>Our third night, after a long hike. Incredible views of Spirit Lake and The Dome. From the pass to the east, you can see Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount St. Helens: 4 volcanoes in one view!</description>

      <title>Ridge Camp</title>
      <description>We were supposed to stay here our fourth night, but the camp was really rather depressing, hot, and we still had a good part of the day ahead of us, so we hiked on.</description>

      <title>South Coldwater Trailhead</title>
      <description>The end of our hike. We had to get from here back to our car, and it's amazing how few people (none, in fact) stop to pick up a hiker in a National Park.</description>
